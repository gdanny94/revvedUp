**Revved Up** is a car photography web app designed for booking professional car photographers. It offers an easy-to-use platform where car enthusiasts and owners can browse photographer profiles, view portfolios, and schedule photoshoots for their vehicles. The app simplifies the booking process, allowing users to select a photographer based on location, availability, and style.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Revved Up** was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a smooth and engaging platform for booking car photographers. **HTML** was used to structure key components, such as photographer profiles, portfolios, and booking forms. **CSS** brought the design to life with sleek styling, responsive layouts, and a modern look, ensuring the app worked well across devices. **JavaScript** powered the interactive features, such as real-time booking, form validation, and dynamic photo galleries, creating a seamless user experience where users can easily browse photographers and schedule appointments with just a few clicks.

## Optimization

Optimizing Image Loading: Since photography is central to the app, lessons in optimizing image loading times, using lazy loading techniques, and ensuring high-quality images without affecting performance were crucial.

## Lessons Learned:

Seamless User Interactions: Implementing interactive features such as booking forms, galleries, and search filters taught the importance of smooth and responsive user interactions, particularly in keeping the process fast and frustration-free for users.
